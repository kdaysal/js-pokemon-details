# Simple JavaScript Pokemon App

## This Pokemon App allows users to selectively view basic details for up to 150 different pokemon characters.

This project is a simple web application that was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in conjunction with jQuery and Bootstrap libraries. Data is fetched from an external API and displayed on the page in the form of a scrollable list. Users can click on any pokemon's name to display additional information about the selected pokemon.

Clicking on the name of a pokemon pops a modal that displays the name, height, types, and an image (front) of the pokemon as retrieved from the api located here: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150
